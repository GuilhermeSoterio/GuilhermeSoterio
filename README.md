<p>Web Systems Student at the Federal Institute of Bras√≠lia. My priority at the moment is my professional development. I focus my study on the following technologies: Javascript, React, pre-processors like Sass and Less and automation tools like Gulp. I am looking for an opportunity to generate value and deliver results.

At the beginning of my career, I tried to be aware of technology companies' demands, and got to understand that being specialist in a certain area is the best way to become more efficient as a developer. That led me to getting more knowledge on JavaScript, which is my main programming language, and I use it with React, but also study Redux, NestJs and PWA. In addition to that, I dedicate part of my time to gaining more expertise in other backend technologies, such as Java and GoLang, so that I become more versatile when it comes to Full Stack development.
